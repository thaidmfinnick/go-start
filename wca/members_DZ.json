Any shipments sent on Collect Basis on a H B/L will cause long delays for payments, and in some cases payments may not be allowed at all. The only possible way in case of collect shipments is to check if the Carrier offers this service and ask them to issue M B/L showing clearly the shipment is on freight collect basis.\n\nFor Air Freight shipments, at this time we can accept on Prepaid basis only.",
